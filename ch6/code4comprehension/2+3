1. calculator00.cpp is compiled and run.
2. A user inputs « 2+3; » and presses Enter.
3. int main() springs into action.
4. val is initialized to zero.
5. The code block in while executes because cin is true.
    Remember a user input « 2+3; »
6. A Token t is declared and ts.get() is called.
7. In ts.get(), if full is true (which it is after a recent)
    full is set to false and buffer, whose value is zero, is
    returned.
8. calculator00.cpp reads the expression « 2 + 3 » after that.
9.
